# MC Server HTMX Panel

## About
Just a proof of concept for a Minecraft server panel using HTMX + Rust.<br>
Please, for the love of god, don't use this in production. Or anywhere else, really.<br>

## How to run
If, for some reason, you want to run this, you'll need to have Rust installed.<br>
Then, just clone the repo, add a minecraft 'server.jar' to the server subdirectory<br>
and run `cargo run`.<br>
Good luck, you'll need it.
